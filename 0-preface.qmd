# Preface {.unnumbered}

*Data science* is transforming how we understand the world, solve problems, and make informed decisions. From generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini to personalized recommendations on streaming platforms and fraud detection in banking, data-driven techniques are reshaping industries and everyday life. As demand grows for professionals who can analyze and model data effectively, accessible and rigorous educational resources are more essential than ever.

*Data Science Foundations and Machine Learning with R: From Data to Decisions* offers a hands-on introduction to this dynamic field. Designed for readers with no prior experience in analytics or programming, the book provides a clear, structured pathway into data science by emphasizing conceptual understanding, practical application, and reproducible workflows using R.

This book is intended for newcomers to data science and machine learning, particularly those without a background in programming or statistics. Whether you are a student, business professional, or researcher, it offers an approachable yet academically grounded learning experience. Drawing on my experience teaching data science at the university level, I emphasize an applied, example-driven approach that fosters active engagement and deep comprehension.

The motivation for this book stems from a recurring challenge I encountered in the classroom: many of my students were eager to explore data science but lacked resources that were both accessible and conceptually rigorous. I saw a clear need for materials that bridge foundational theory and meaningful application. My goal was to provide a guided, practical learning experience, lowering the barrier to entry without sacrificing depth, through real data and hands-on practice in R.

To support a smoother learning curve, the book adopts *active learning strategies*. Concepts are introduced progressively and reinforced through illustrative examples, guided coding exercises, and applied problem-solving. By working directly with authentic datasets and practical scenarios, readers learn not only how data science tools work, but also when and why to use them. This experiential approach fosters lasting understanding and builds confidence in applying these skills independently.

Rather than presenting machine learning as a purely theoretical discipline, the book integrates annotated code, real datasets, and structured walkthroughs throughout. Each chapter concludes with a case study that applies the chapter’s core ideas to a realistic context, bridging the gap between theory and practice. Exercises further reinforce learning through direct implementation in R, helping readers develop both conceptual clarity and practical fluency.

## Why This Book? {.unnumbered}

*Data science* is a rapidly evolving field that integrates machine learning, statistical modeling, and computational tools to extract insights from data. This book provides a structured, application-focused introduction to data analysis and machine learning using R, a widely adopted, open-source language known for its strengths in statistical computing, visualization, and reproducible workflows.

Unlike many textbooks that assume prior experience with programming or analytics, this book is designed to be *accessible and hands-on*. Concepts are introduced clearly and reinforced through real-world examples, guided exercises, and annotated R code. This approach allows readers to build theoretical understanding alongside practical fluency from the outset.

With its extensive ecosystem of packages, R remains a leading tool for data science across academic, industrial, and research settings. This book emphasizes its practical use in solving data-driven problems. For readers who prefer Python, a companion volume titled *Data Science Foundations and Machine Learning with Python: From Data to Decisions* is also available from the same publisher.

Each chapter integrates illustrative examples, annotated R code, and exercises that reinforce learning through practice. Chapters conclude with a case study that synthesizes the main concepts, guiding you in applying techniques to authentic scenarios. This structure ensures that by the end of the book, you are not just familiar with the tools; you are equipped to use them thoughtfully and effectively.

## Structure of This Book {.unnumbered}

This book is structured around the *Data Science Workflow*, an iterative framework that guides you from foundational concepts to advanced machine learning techniques through hands-on learning. Your journey begins in Chapter [-@sec-ch1-intro-R], where you will install R, explore its syntax, and work with essential data structures. From there, each chapter builds on the previous one, combining coding practice with real-world case studies to help you gain both understanding and experience.

```{r fig-ch0_DSW, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap = "The Data Science Workflow is an iterative framework for structuring data science and machine learning projects. Inspired by the CRISP-DM model (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), it supports systematic problem-solving and continuous refinement."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch2_DSW.png")  
```

The *Data Science Workflow*, introduced in Chapter [-@sec-ch2-intro-data-science] and illustrated in @fig-ch0_DSW, consists of seven key stages:

1.  *Problem Understanding*: Define the objective and the broader context (Chapter [-@sec-ch2-intro-data-science]).

2.  *Data Preparation*: Clean, transform, and organize raw data (Chapter [-@sec-ch3-data-preparation]).

3.  *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Visualize and summarize data to uncover patterns (Chapter [-@sec-ch4-EDA]).

4.  *Data Setup for Modeling*: Select features, partition datasets, and scale variables (Chapter [-@sec-ch6-setup-data]).

5.  *Modeling*: Build and train predictive models using a range of machine learning algorithms (Chapters [-@sec-ch7-classification-knn] to [-@sec-ch13-clustering]).

6.  *Evaluation*: Measure model performance using appropriate metrics (Chapter [-@sec-ch8-evaluation]).

7.  *Deployment*: Translate models into real-world applications.

This workflow provides a practical and repeatable framework for tackling data-driven problems. The chapter sequence mirrors these phases, supporting a gradual progression from theory to implementation.

Chapter [-@sec-ch5-statistics] also provides a concise review of key statistical ideas, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, that support critical thinking and model interpretation.

To bridge theory and practice, each chapter concludes with a case study that applies its core ideas to a real-world problem. These case studies walk through the *Data Science Workflow* in action: guiding you through data preparation, model development, evaluation, and interpretation using real datasets. The datasets, listed in Table @tbl-data-table, are available through the **liver** package. This enables you to reproduce examples, complete exercises, and build practical skills with minimal setup.

Each chapter ends with exercises designed to consolidate learning: from conceptual questions and hands-on coding tasks to applied problem-solving challenges. These help reinforce key ideas, encourage experimentation, and build confidence in using R for data science.
