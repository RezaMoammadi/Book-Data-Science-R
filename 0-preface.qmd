# Preface {.unnumbered}

*Data science* integrates statistical reasoning, machine learning techniques, and computational tools to transform raw data into insight and informed decisions. From predictive models used in finance and healthcare to modern machine learning systems underlying generative AI applications, data-driven methods increasingly shape how complex problems are understood and addressed. As these techniques become central across disciplines and industries, the need for accessible yet rigorous educational resources has never been greater.

*Data Science Foundations and Machine Learning with R: From Data to Decisions* provides a hands-on introduction to this field. Designed for readers with no prior experience in analytics, programming, or formal statistics, the book offers a clear and structured pathway into data science by combining foundational statistical concepts with modern machine learning methods. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding, practical implementation, and reproducible workflows using R.

The motivation for this book emerged from a recurring challenge encountered in the classroom. Many students were eager to learn data science and machine learning, yet struggled to find resources that were simultaneously accessible, conceptually rigorous, and practically oriented. Existing materials often emphasized either theoretical abstraction or software mechanics in isolation, leaving beginners uncertain about how methods connect to real analytical problems. This book was written to address that gap. It is intended for newcomers to data science and machine learning, including undergraduate and graduate students, professionals transitioning into data-driven roles, and researchers seeking a practical introduction. Drawing on my experience teaching data science at the university level, the exposition adopts an applied, example-driven approach that integrates statistical foundations with hands-on modeling. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry without sacrificing depth, academic rigor, or relevance to real-world decision-making.

To support a smooth learning trajectory for readers with diverse backgrounds, the book adopts *active learning* strategies throughout. Concepts are introduced progressively and reinforced through illustrative examples, guided coding tasks, and applied problem-solving activities embedded directly within the main text. Newly introduced ideas are followed by in-text boxes labeled *Practice*, which invite readers to pause and apply concepts immediately in R as they are encountered. Each chapter also concludes with a case study that applies the chapter’s core ideas to a realistic data-driven scenario, bridging the gap between methodological concepts and real-world application. In addition, every chapter includes a substantial set of end-of-chapter exercises that consolidate learning through more extended implementation. Together, the in-text *Practice* boxes, case studies, and exercises form a coherent learning framework that steadily develops both conceptual understanding and practical proficiency.

## Why This Book? {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book was written to provide a clear, structured, and application-focused introduction to data science and machine learning using R. While data science continues to evolve rapidly, many existing textbooks either emphasize theoretical development without sufficient practical guidance or focus narrowly on software usage without establishing conceptual foundations. This book aims to bridge that gap by integrating statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and computational tools within a coherent learning framework.

Unlike many textbooks that assume prior experience with programming or analytics, this book is designed to be accessible to beginners while remaining academically rigorous. Core concepts are introduced gradually and reinforced through real-world examples, guided exercises, and annotated R code. This approach enables readers to develop theoretical understanding alongside practical fluency from the outset, fostering confidence in applying methods to realistic data-driven problems.

R is a widely adopted, open-source language with a rich ecosystem of packages for statistical computing, visualization, and reproducible analysis. This book emphasizes its practical use across academic, industrial, and research settings. For readers who prefer Python, a companion volume titled *Data Science Foundations and Machine Learning with Python: From Data to Decisions* is available from the same publisher. Further information about both books can be found at <https://datasciencebook.ai>.

## Who Should Read This Book? {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book is intended for readers seeking a clear and practical introduction to data science and machine learning, particularly those who are new to the field. It is designed to support a broad audience, ranging from students encountering data analysis for the first time to professionals aiming to incorporate data-driven reasoning into their work.

## Skills You Will Gain {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book guides you through a practical and progressive journey into data science and machine learning using R, structured around the *Data Science Workflow* (Figure [-@fig-ch0_DSW]). The workflow emphasizes how to move from a clearly defined problem to a data-driven solution through statistical analysis and machine learning. Each chapter supports both conceptual understanding and applied skill development, guiding readers from formulating analytical questions and preparing data to building, evaluating, and interpreting models.

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

-   *Identify and explain* the key stages of a data science project, from problem formulation and data preparation to modeling and evaluation;

-   *Apply* core R programming concepts, including data structures, control flow, and functions, to explore, prepare, and analyze data;

-   *Prepare and transform* raw datasets by addressing missing values, outliers, and categorical variables using established best practices;

-   *Explore and interpret* data using descriptive statistics and effective visualizations;

-   *Build, tune, and interpret* machine learning models for classification, regression, and clustering, including methods such as k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, decision trees, neural networks, and K-means clustering;

-   *Evaluate and compare* model performance using appropriate metrics tailored to different analytical tasks;

-   *Apply and adapt* data science techniques to real-world problems in domains such as marketing, finance, operations, and the social sciences.

Throughout the book, these skills are reinforced through illustrative examples, annotated R code, and practice-oriented exercises. Each chapter concludes with a case study that synthesizes the main concepts and demonstrates how methods can be applied in realistic settings. By the end of the book, readers are equipped not only with familiarity with data science tools, but also with the ability to apply them critically, responsibly, and effectively in practice.

## Requirements and Expectations {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book assumes no prior experience with programming, statistics, or data science. It is designed to be accessible to beginners while maintaining academic rigor, with core concepts introduced gradually and reinforced through real-world examples, guided exercises, and annotated R code.

The material has been developed and refined through teaching at the undergraduate level, particularly for students in econometrics, social sciences, and the natural sciences. Many of these students begin with little or no background in programming, machine learning, or formal statistics. This teaching experience has directly informed the structure, pacing, and level of exposition adopted throughout the book.

Readers are expected to have only basic familiarity with using a computer and installing software. No prior programming experience is assumed, as all necessary R concepts are introduced from first principles. While selected statistical ideas are discussed later in the book, particularly in Chapter [-@sec-ch5-statistics], no formal background in statistics is required.

Successful engagement with the material does, however, require a willingness to learn actively. Readers are encouraged to work through the in-text *Practice* boxes, experiment with code, and complete the end-of-chapter exercises, as hands-on problem-solving is central to the learning approach adopted throughout the book.

All tools and software used in this book are freely available, and detailed installation instructions are provided in Chapter [-@sec-ch1-intro-R]. There are no requirements regarding a specific operating system or computer architecture. It is assumed only that readers have access to a computer capable of running R and RStudio, along with an internet connection for downloading packages and datasets.

## Structure of This Book {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book is structured around the *Data Science Workflow* (Figure [-@fig-ch0_DSW]), an iterative framework that emphasizes how data science projects progress from problem formulation to data-driven solutions through statistical analysis and machine learning. The journey begins in Chapter [-@sec-ch1-intro-R], where readers install R, become familiar with its syntax, and work with essential data structures. From there, each chapter builds on the previous one, combining conceptual development with hands-on coding and real-world case studies.

```{r fig-ch0_DSW, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap = "The Data Science Workflow is an iterative framework for structuring data science and machine learning projects. Inspired by the CRISP-DM model (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), it supports systematic problem-solving and continuous refinement."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch2_DSW.png")  
```

The *Data Science Workflow*, introduced in Chapter [-@sec-ch2-intro-data-science] and illustrated in Figure [-@fig-ch0_DSW], consists of seven key stages:

1.  *Problem Understanding*: Defining the analytical objective and broader context (Chapter [-@sec-ch2-intro-data-science]).

2.  *Data Preparation*: Cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data (Chapter [-@sec-ch3-data-preparation]).

3.  *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Visualizing and summarizing data to uncover patterns and relationships (Chapter [-@sec-ch4-EDA]).

4.  *Data Setup for Modeling*: Selecting features, partitioning datasets, and scaling variables (Chapter [-@sec-ch6-setup-data]).

5.  *Modeling*: Building and training predictive models using a range of machine learning algorithms (Chapters [-@sec-ch7-classification-knn] through [-@sec-ch13-clustering]).

6.  *Evaluation*: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and validation strategies (Chapter [-@sec-ch8-evaluation]).

7.  *Deployment*: Translating analytical insights into real-world decisions and applications.

The sequence of chapters mirrors these stages, supporting a gradual progression from foundational concepts to applied modeling. Chapter [-@sec-ch5-statistics] complements this progression by providing a focused introduction to key statistical ideas, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, which underpin critical reasoning, uncertainty assessment, and model interpretation.

To bridge theory and practice, newly introduced ideas throughout each chapter are accompanied by illustrative examples and in-text boxes labeled *Practice*, which invite readers to pause and apply concepts immediately in R as they are encountered. Each chapter then concludes with a case study that applies its core ideas to a realistic data-driven problem, demonstrating the *Data Science Workflow* in action through data preparation, model development, evaluation, and interpretation using real datasets. The datasets used throughout the book, summarized in Table [-@tbl-data-table], are made available through the **liver** package, enabling readers to reproduce analyses, complete exercises, and experiment with methods in a consistent environment. Each chapter also includes a set of exercises designed to consolidate learning, ranging from conceptual questions to hands-on coding tasks and applied problem-solving challenges, together reinforcing key ideas and building confidence in applying R for data science.

## How to Use This Book {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book is designed for self-study, classroom instruction, and professional learning. Readers may work through the chapters sequentially to follow a structured learning path or consult individual chapters and sections to focus on specific skills or concepts as needed. Regardless of the mode of use, active engagement with the material is essential to achieving the learning objectives of the book.

Readers are encouraged to run the R code examples interactively, experiment with modifications, and explore alternative parameter settings or datasets to reinforce key ideas through hands-on experience. In particular, readers should actively engage with the in-text boxes labeled *Practice*, which appear immediately after new concepts are introduced and are intended to prompt immediate application and reflection. Each chapter also includes exercises that range from conceptual questions to applied coding tasks, providing further opportunities to deepen understanding and develop analytical fluency. End-of-chapter case studies offer a comprehensive view of the Data Science Workflow in practice, guiding readers through data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation in realistic analytical contexts.

The book also supports collaborative learning. Working through exercises, *Practice* boxes, and case studies in pairs or small groups can stimulate discussion, deepen conceptual understanding, and expose readers to diverse analytical perspectives, particularly in classroom and workshop settings.
